<h1>The best movies of all time</h1>
<h2>My most favourite movies in my life</h2>
<hr>
<h2>Spirited Away</h2>
<p>Spirited Away was one of my first anime movies and the display of fantasy was just wonderful and it brought me a lot of joy and happiness</p>
<h2>In Time</h2>
<p> I truly enjoyed this movie piece because I really liked the idea of having money as a form of payment. I sometimes wished it was like that in the real world but then again it can be really stressfull if you think about it
</p>
<h2>Paprika</h2>
<p>Paprika is the anime version of Inception. But I enjoyed the anime version more because it was more bizzare and had mor abstract thoughts behind it. By animating it you could see thinngs that you cannot animate with real humans.</p>
