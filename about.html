<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My Name is Matteo Nell BA. I am a beginner to webdesign but am thrilled at how much I have while doing so. This is one of many Projects I would like to do in the futre and as a fulltimeposition
</p>

<p>I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology and have been working as a DataAnalyst for the past 2 years. I am really happy to be able to programm this website and it is all due to the udemy course I took.
</p>

<p>My favourite part about programming is that it feels like art to me. Since I create something out of nothing and there is a visual display when I do it.</p>
